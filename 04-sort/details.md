# sort
Sorts a given file or input.

## Why is it useful?
Sometimes it's useful to sort the contents of a file or the input from another command.  It's also useful with the `uniq` command covered next.

## Basic usage
`sort [file]`

## Example
`sort names.txt` Sorts the names.txt file

`sort -n numbers.txt` Numerically sorts the numbers.txt file (assuming the age or some numeric value is the first value of each row)
